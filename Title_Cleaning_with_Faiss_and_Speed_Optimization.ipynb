**\"paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2\"** and **\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"** are both pre-trained models for generating sentence embeddings, but they differ in architecture and training data:\n\n**paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2**: This model is based on the MPNet architecture, which is designed for pre-training language models using a self-supervised learning objective that combines masked language modeling and permutation language modeling. It is fine-tuned specifically for paraphrasing tasks, which means it is trained to understand sentences that have the same meaning but are expressed differently.\n\n**all-MiniLM-L6-v2**: This model is a smaller version of the larger MiniLM models, with only 6 layers. It is designed to be more efficient while still providing high-quality sentence embeddings. It is trained on a variety of tasks and datasets, making it a more general-purpose model.\n\nFor working with titles, which are typically short and concise, the choice between the two models may depend on the specific requirements of your task:\n\nIf you need embeddings that are more sensitive to paraphrasing and semantic similarity, \"paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2\" might be more suitable.\nIf efficiency is a concern and you want a model that is faster and lighter but still performs well on a range of tasks, \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" could be a better choice.","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":true}},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3fbdf6e2-a2a6-435f-8bb4-75a965f6859e"},{"source":"# Cleaning the titles of
